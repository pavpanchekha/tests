Tests is a lightweight testing framework for commandline applications. It has a
simple syntax oriented at making tests easy to write. It is inspired by
docutils, but extends beyond simply python. It was originally created to test
oranj.

= SYNTAX =
Tests parses your test files line-by-line. It recognizes five types of lines.

== Comments ==
Lines that begin with "##" are comments to Tests. It discards these lines. Eg.

## Test looping constructs

== Tools Declarations ==
Lines beginning wth "#!" are tool declarations. These are specifically
structured to look like bash shebang lines. All tests following a tool
declaration will use that tool (until a new tool is declared). Eg.

#!python

Tool declarations are simply command lines, and can thus include arguments.
This is especially useful for tests a tool like python, which requires a
separate argument for it to read from stdin without prompts of any sort.

Again, tool declarations carry through all future tests (until the next tool
declaration). However, the tool is restarted for each test.

== Descriptions ==
Lines that begin with "# " (yes, the space is required) describe the next test.
They can be multiple lines long (each prefixed with "# ", of course) but may
not come after the input lines.

== Input lines ==
Lines that begin with ">>> " (yes, the space is required) denote input passed
to the tool. This is passed through a pipe, so make sure that the tool reads
directly from stdin without prompts.

== Output lines ==
All other lines are output lines. Note that blank lines are ignored, thus your
output cannot have blank lines. On the other hand, this frees you to separate
test cases by whitespace.

Note that output MUST BE SENT TO stdout. This may require you to use print
statements or the equivalent.

The lines must be in the order given here. Otherwise, you will be unwittingly
adding test cases.

= EXAMPLE =

#!python

## Test array subscripting opperations

# Basic indexing
>>> a = [0, 1, 2]
>>> print a[0]
0

# Slicing
>>> a = [0, 1, 2]
>>> print a[0:2]
[0, 1]
